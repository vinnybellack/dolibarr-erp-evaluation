1. Overview of Dolibarr ERP System
Dolibarr is an opensource ERP and CRM system that‚Äôs designed to help businesses of all sizes
whether you're a freelancer, a small company, or a larger organization manage daily operations in
one place. It combines everything from sales and HR to finance and inventory, offering a flexible
and modular approach that allows teams to use only the tools they actually need.Dolibarr is
supported by a global network of developers, translators, and business users. This open-source
model means the platform is always improving. Because of ongoing community feedback, the
user experience is intuitive and practical, especially for teams with limited technical knowledge.
Why Dolibarr Stands Out
One of the most attractive things about Dolibarr is that it‚Äôs an all-in-one platform. You don‚Äôt need
separate software for each department; everything works together under one roof. For example,
once you enable the HR and Project modules, employees can log hours, request leave, and
managers can assign and track tasks all from the same interface.
There‚Äôs no need to worry about complex setup or manual integrations. Everything is already built
to connect. And if your needs change, you can add more features later. Dolibarr updates are
designed in such a way that you can upgrade at any time without losing data or breaking
anything.
Easy to Customize
Dolibarr is highly customizable. You can use the built-in Module Builder to tweak features without
needing to write code. And if your business has very specific requirements, you can explore
thousands of ready-made plugins through the Dolistore marketplace. Developers can also build
custom modules if needed.
Where You Can Use It
There are two main choices:
Install it on your own servers (on-premise) if you have an IT team.
Or use Dolibarr as a cloud service, which is a quicker and easier option for most teams.
Cloud Hosting Services
Several companies offer cloud-hosted versions of Dolibarr. The official one is DoliCloud,
managed by the core Dolibarr team. Others include:
DoliPlace (by Inovea Conseil)
DoliOnDemand (by ATM Consulting)
Ma Gestion Cloud (by Aplose)
DoliBox (by iNodbox)
DoliPlatform (by 19 Coop)
BitNami (by VMware)
UnboxCRM (by UnBox USA)
These services offer secure hosting, backups, updates, and support, so you don‚Äôt need to worry
about technical stuff.

with others.

2.1. HR, Attendance & Leave Management:-
Features are meant to make everyday employee management smoother. They help keep track of
staff details, monitor attendance (like when someone clocks in or out), and manage leave
requests without all the paperwork. Instead of manually tracking everything, the system makes it
easy for both employees and HR teams to handle things like sick days, vacation, or working
hours ‚Äì all in one place. It really helps save time and avoid confusion, especially as teams grow.
Functions-Manage employee records and attendance tracking.Submit and approve leave
requests; manage time logs and internal messages.

There are 16 Modules in the Dolibarr dashboard in which some have been grouped for their
unanimity. Some which i didnt include were Members, MRP and Product Modules.
Members is designed to manage individuals or organizations who are part of an association,
club, or any non-profit setup. You can register members, track their contact details, membership
status, subscription fees, renewal dates, and even categorize them into different groups. It‚Äôs
especially useful for NGOs, federations, and clubs where managing member lists and payments
is important. This module helps keep everything organized and ensures you don‚Äôt lose track of
anyone.
MRP, or Material Requirements Planning, is used to plan and manage the materials and
components needed for manufacturing. It helps make sure you have the right materials, in the
right quantity, at the right time so production runs smoothly without delays or shortages. The
system checks inventory levels, tracks purchase orders, and forecasts what‚Äôs needed based on
current demand or production schedules. It‚Äôs especially useful in manufacturing or product-based
businesses that need tight control over stock and supply chains.
Product You can add details like names, prices, categories, stock levels, and descriptions.
Whether you're selling physical goods or offering services, this module keeps everything
organized. It also connects with other parts of the system like sales, inventory, purchasing, and
billing so when a product is sold, stock levels update automatically, and invoices can be
generated right away. It‚Äôs the core of how your business tracks what it sells.

1. If you're just getting started or setting things up for interns, the cloud version like
DoliCloud is the easiest way to go. No setup hassle just login and start using it
2. If you Don‚Äôt have an IT team or any server experience, Stick with the cloud-hosted option.
It handles all the updates, backups, and tech stuff for you.
3. Planning to use Dolibarr long term and want to tweak it for your specific needs? Go with
the self-hosted version. You‚Äôll have full control and can customize it however you like.
4. Need to store a lot of data or want more room to grow? Self hosting makes more sense
as you won‚Äôt be limited by storage caps like in most cloud plans.
